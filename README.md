This is a little game project meant for experimenting with the Bevy game engine.

So far, it consists of some custom physics stuff for fixed-point AABB collisions. Not much else interesting so far.

I do have some ideas for interesting directions to take this, but of course, that may be a bad idea for the first project with a given game engine.
